      "<p>\"I think there's about forty thousand in my Gringotts vault,\"\n",

      "fluttering silver sparrow.</p>\n",
      "<p>His dark side had also noticed, when it was looking through the\n",

      "that the enemy had been foolish enough to bring a Dementor into\n",
      "Harry's presence. That was a powerful weapon indeed, and one that\n",
      "Harry might wield better than its supposed masters. There had been\n",
      "a time in Azkaban when Harry had told twelve Dementors to turn and\n",
      "go, and they had gone.</p>\n",

      "<em>anticipations</em> of the mindless void, or Harry's threat of\n",

      "<p>It was the other solution his dark side had devised.</p>\n",
      "<p>Ignoring the gasps rising from behind him, Harry crossed the\n",
      "radius of the Patronuses, strode to a single pace from Death. Its\n",
      "unhindered fear burst around him like a whirlpool, like stepping\n",
      "next to the sucking drain of some huge bathtub emptying out its\n",
      "water; but with the false Patronuses no longer obscuring the level\n",
      "on which they interacted, Harry could reach the Dementor even as it\n",

      "<p>In the hall there was a deathly silence.</p>\n",
      "<p>Harry turned his back on the empty void, and looked up at where\n",

      "<p>Professor McGonagall was holding Hermione so firmly that you\n",
      "might have thought it was a mother holding her daughter, or maybe\n",
      "granddaughter. After a few moments Hermione's sobs slowed, and then\n",
      "stopped. Professor McGonagall suddenly shifted her stance and\n",
      "grabbed onto her more tightly; the girl's hands were dangling\n",
      "limply, now, and her eyes were closed -</p>\n",
      "<p>\"She'll be fine, Mr. Potter,\" Professor McGonagall said softly\n",
      "in Harry's direction, without looking at him. \"She just needs a few\n",
      "hours in one of Madam Pomfrey's beds.\"</p>\n",
